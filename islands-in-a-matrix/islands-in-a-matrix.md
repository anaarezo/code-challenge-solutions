You are given a 2D matrix, in which 0 represents water and 1 represents land. If two 1s share an edge or a corner, they can be considered as part of the same island, otherwise not. Find the number of islands in the matrix.

## Input Format

First line contains the dimensions and .
The next lines contain the 2D matrix, numbers in each.

## Constraints

```shell
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= M <= 1000
```

## Output Format

A single integer representing number of islands.

## Sample Input 0

```shell
4 4
1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1
```
